Trump claims fact-checked\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Gerry Georgieva, Tom Edgington, Lucy Gilder BBC Verify Share Save\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nPresident Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\". He has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 104% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. Some of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\nIs the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?\n\nIs the US running a $1 trillion deficit with China?\n\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China. \"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. The US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China. Official figures show it was just over $295bn (£230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (£780bn) claimed by Trump. Globally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (£780bn) more goods than it imported. But, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\n\nDoes Canada charge 270% on US dairy products?\n\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products. \"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. It is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions. Under the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\n\nGetty Images A tariff war could create uncertainly for American dairy farmers\n\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (£892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024. Despite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas. The IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\". Trade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\n\nDoes the EU import no US cars?\n\nGetty Images Trump is exaggerating when he says that the EU takes \"no\" cars."

    "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a reason why Jennifer Hudson gave Noah Wyle a “hall pass” from dancing his way through her show’s Spirit Tunnel.\n\n“The Pitt” star declined enter “The Jennifer Hudson Show” set the way many guests have, which is to dance through a “tunnel” created by a team of show employees as they clap and sing.\n\nWyle later explained to Hudson why he declined to show of his moves.\n\n“It would’ve triggered a bigger breakdown than I had on (‘The Pitt’) two weeks ago if I had done it,” Wyle said.\n\nViewers of his hit medical drama know that Wyle was referencing a particularly intense episode in which his character, Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, was overcome with emotion after suffering the loss of a patient following a mass shooting.\n\nWyle said a classmate’s bar mitzvah in 1984 has forever deterred him from dancing in public. At the time, the actor said, he “fancied” himself a breakdancer.\n\n“I went out and I heard Herbie Hancock’s ‘Rockit’ playing in front of all my classmates,” Wyle recalled. “And I attempted the worm and I got into some kind of inverted position and it all collapsed on me.”\n\nSo while he would have loved to have shown the same type of enthusiasm for Hudson’s Spirit Tunnel, he said “nobody needs to see that.” Wyle threw out that he might attempt to “babystep it.”\n\nHudson was understanding.\n\n“We’re just happy to have you here,” she said.\n\nWyle is not the only guest to have gone their own way.\n\nProducer and musician Benny Blanco, who is engaged to Selena Gomez, handed out flowers instead of grooving down the Spirit Tunnel."
